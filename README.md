Hi I'm Kerry!

👨‍🎓 4th year CS Specialist at UofT.\
💼 Just finished an awesome 8 month work term at [Moves Financial](https://movesfinancial.com/) \
💪 I've done full-stack web and mobile development at two different companies now and did a surprising amount of project mangagement for an intern. Frontend, backend, and project organization are my strong suits!\
\
I took CSC301 which I think is a smaller version of CSC454/CSC491. If I learned anything from that, it's that commitment >>> people who are accomplished but have little time for the course. I'm willing to make this course my top priority and I'm hoping my teammates have the time as well. 🙌

Cheers~
